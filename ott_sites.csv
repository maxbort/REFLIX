Created by Maddocks Cartoon Productions, it originally ran for 25 episodes between 1985 and 1986.

The premise of the cartoon is that Jimbo was originally intended to be a Jumbo Jet, but his designer could not tell the difference between inches and centimetres, resulting in his diminutive size. If Jimbo's designer switched the imperial measurements of the Boeing 747 for metric, the result would have been an aircraft with a fuselage length of 91 ft; this would make Jimbo roughly the length of an early-series Boeing 737.

The television series features various talking airport-type ground vehicles: Tommy Tow-Truck, Claude Catering, Amanda Baggage, Phil the Fuel Truck, Sammy Steps and Harry Helicopter. Other plane characters appear from time to time, such as Old Timer, a Vickers Wellington bomber who gets into the story while flying to or from an airshow.

Carl names him C2. Even though C2 looks like Carl, talks like him, and walks like him, C2 is more ambitious, hard-working, and charming, much to Carl's advantage. Since C2 arrived, Carl has been slacking off a lot more. However, C2 often does the opposite to what Carl wants. Carl decides to keep C2 a secret from everyone else except his best friend Jamie James.

This show is about a spunky dog who is abducted by aliens from Planet Zmed, whose king is King Adrian, sets two of Zmed's explorers, named Dave and Blark, in search for Earth's leader; the one that everyone follows.

At the very moment that they reached the Earth, a dog was trying to escape a maximum security city pound. With so many dogcatchers chasing the dog, Dave and Blark mistook the dog for Earth's leader. Immediately, they caught the dog, and the people of Zmed swore him in as a leader.

Mainly, the newly named ""Leader"" is showing the people of Zmed what and how he does things on Earth. But with Leader being a dog, he is mainly showing the race what he and other dogs do on earth. With this, some of the more canine things he does are considered great feats to the Zmedians, like drinking from the toilet, playing dead, and even having a massive and rather nasty bowel movement.

The characters consist of King Adrian, the king who loves Leader and his ways, as well as Adrian's son, a spoiled young prince named Prince Guz who totally despises Leader in every way; and the twin explorers named Dave and Blark who saved Leader.

The show was created by a Burbank, California production company Popular Arts Entertainment, with Jonathan Katz and Tom Snyder, developed and first made by Popular Arts for HBO Downtown Productions. Boston-based Tom Snyder Productions became the hands-on production company, and the episodes were usually produced by Katz and Loren Bouchard.

The show was computer animated in a crude, easily recognizable style produced with the software Squigglevision in which all persons and animate objects are colored and have constantly squiggling outlines, while most other inanimate objects are static and usually gray in color. The original challenge Popular Arts faced was how to repurpose recorded stand-up comedy material. To do so they based Dr. Katz's patients on stand-up comics for the first several episodes, simply having them recite their stand-up acts. The secondary challenge was how to affordably animate on cable TV at the time. Snyder had Squigglevision, an inexpensive means of getting animation on cable, which could not afford traditional animation processes.

It was created by George and his wife, Peggy Sarson. Although it is primarily aimed at young children, it has found popularity with pre-teens to young adults because despite the fairly young and lighthearted appearance of the show, it had some rather dark undertones beneath the surface. Its cult appreciation has also stemmed from the fact that Toad Patrol had so much time and effort put into it. This series has a very distinct beginning, middle, and end to each season it airs. The story was in the works since 1985 and was in the development stage as the creators started selling Mistle Toad chocolates and cream pops to raise money. The show eventually managed to get animated overseas in both Korea, AKOM and India, UTV Toons. Although, a lot of the in-betweening and other works were done in Canada at Funbag and Helix studios.

A show sponsor page has stated that 13 episodes of the series are currently in production. Several fans had assumed that with the passing of Long John Baldry, the series had been halted however, that is not the case. After discovering that Mistle Toad had two voice actors, fans are now sure that if a third season were to appear then that voice actor would take his place. However, after more than five years without an original episode and no further news of any additional planned broadcasts, the possibility of additional episodes of the series remains doubtful at best.",,https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/4516?language=ko,animation,

According to the website Toonhound, it was originally to be entitled Streatham Hill, but was renamed Bromwell High in January 2005. Streatham Hill is a real London suburb, while Bromwell is fictional.

Subsequent international purchases have seen the show screened in the United States on BBC America, on The Box in the Netherlands, dubbed to Spanish and Portuguese on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim in Latin America, on the ABC in Australia, on TVNZ's TV2 in New Zealand, and also dubbed in French for the Canadian Télétoon network.

It stars three trouble-making girls, Keisha, Latrina, and Natella as they wreak havoc on their impoverished school and its teachers.

The show was designed by David Whittle, who is also responsible for illustrating the popjustice icons series of books.

The show represents a caricatured view of contemporary British society. For example, the majority of students at Bromwell High School are immigrant children from the Caribbean and Asia, and some of the male teachers are aging 'chavs'.

Many recognizable characters have been featured in at least one episode such as Bugs Bunny, Popeye, Porky Pig, Tom and Jerry, and others not so famous such as Goopy Geer and The Captain and the Kids. The shorts often appeared uncut and uncensored, and the more controversial cartoons were often introduced with a brief warning by Mankiewicz about the ethnic stereotypes being portrayed. The network's logo was only featured for a brief time, usually during the last short featured.

From November 2004 to September 2005 the series was featured just once a month but after popular demand the series became a weekly feature.

The show featured the adventures of a girl called Mary, her dog Mungo, and her pet mouse Midge, who lived in a tower block in a busy town. BBC newsreader Richard Baker narrated the episodes, with John Ryan's daughter Isabel playing Mary. The theme tune and other music for the series was provided by Johnny Pearson.

This show was one of the first children's shows in the UK to reflect urban living. The programme showed Mary having adventures in a busy town, as opposed to in a wood, forest or other rural setting. The two featured animals were likely to be familiar to town dwellers, as opposed to the array of talking wildlife usually seen in children's television.

In each episode, the three of them would descend in the lift from their flat in the tower block. After their adventures they would return home, Midge would press the button for the lift back to the correct floor, by standing on Mungo's nose.

The series was produced by Nelvana, a Toronto animation studio, and created by Canadian David Fine and Brit Alison Snowden. The series was based on the Academy Award winning short film Bob's Birthday, featuring the same main characters, which won the Best Animated Short Film Oscar in 1994. The series is one of the few Canadian TV shows to ever have regular American exposure. In Canada, it was the highest rated Canadian made animation series ever when it aired in prime time on Global Television.

The show revolved around a married English couple named Bob and Margaret Fish, a middle class 40-ish working couple with no children and two dogs named William and Elizabeth. Bob is a dentist and Margaret is a chiropodist. Bob and Margaret struggle with everyday issues and mid life crisis. Stories often revolve around the mundane, but in a way which is eminently relatable. From the trials of shopping to dealing with friends who annoy them, but owe them a dinner.

In the first two seasons, Bob and Margaret lived in England, in the South London community of Balham. For the third and fourth seasons, however, they moved to Toronto, Canada, allowing the writers to explore the humour of culture clash. The move was actually inspired by the realities of funding, with certain Canadian tax benefits dependent on stories actually based in Canada. As such, to keep the series funded, the move was necessary. The creators of the series chose to take an executive role on these latter two seasons, reviewing scripts and consulting, but not involved in the detail they were for the first two seasons. Snowden continued to provide the voice of Margaret, but Bob's voice, originally played by Andy Hamilton, was replaced by Brian George.",cartoon adult animation,https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/4999?language=ko,animation,

Miś Uszatek's first appearance was in a Polish comic magazine for children, ""Miś"", on 6 March 1957. Later, he was the main character of several children's books, which were translated into many languages. However, it became very popular in 1975, when Łódź' Animated Forms Studio, Se-ma-for, created a series of cartoons for the Polish TV network, featuring actor Mieczysław Czechowicz, who voiced the characters. In all-time Polish ranks of animated programs, it usually comes second only to Bolek i Lolek.

Miś Uszatek and his friends - Prosiaczek, Króliczki and Zajączek, as well as Kruczek the Puppy - were loved by pre-teen kids. At the same time, Uszatek, a teddy bear, played the role of a friend from kindergarten. He was also liked by parents, as he would always go to bed at appropriate hour, singing the goodnight song:

Altogether, Se-ma-for created 104 episodes of the cartoon; the last one was made in 1987. In the 1960s, two theatrical movies about the friendly bear were made. Also, in the fall of 2007, the Se-ma-for studio announced that it was planning to make more episodes, but later these plans changed in favor of a possible full-length movie, to be created with help from the Japanese company Eden Entertainment.

The animated spots featured Timer, a tiny cartoon character who represented the sense of ""time"" in the human body. Timer was in charge of when a person felt it was time to eat, time to sleep, etc. He carried a large pocket watch inside of him, which would often set off an alarm whenever something was about to happen.

Usually wearing a bow tie and top hat, Timer looked somewhat like a little yellow blob with long arms and legs, and a face. Timer also had limited magical powers, such as instant transportation, which he often used to exit his host body from time to time if things got too exhausting. A wise-cracker as well as a song-and-dance man, Timer promoted healthy eating and personal hygiene for children, using clever songs and animation.

Like ABC's The Bod Squad series, the segments never carried official titles, but are referred to by memorable catch phrases in the songs' lyrics. Perhaps most memorable was ""I Hanker for a Hunk of Cheese"" in which Timer, recast as a cowboy with a thick Western accent, suggests ""wagon wheels,"" sandwiches made with cheese slices and crackers as an easy and nutritious snack.

The segments generally appeared at half-hour intervals, interspersed with regular commercials, between Saturday morning cartoon programs.

The series is actually called Flash Gordon but the expanded title is used in official records to distinguish it from previous versions.

The series was a homage to the original Flash Gordon comic strip and featured most of the original characters, including Flash's girlfriend Dale Arden, and the scientist Hans Zarkov. The series is still regarded as one of the most faithful adaptations, and one of Filmation's finest overall efforts.

The basic story follows Flash and his companions as they travel to Mongo, where they are forced into battle by its ruler, Ming the Merciless, his daughter Princess Aura, and his army of Metal Men. To help their cause the heroes lead the formation of an alliance beginning with King Thun, leader of the Lion People; Prince Barin, ruler of Arboria; and King Vultan, leader of the Hawkmen.

The original project was produced as a made-for-television feature film. When NBC saw the finished work, it was decided to turn the work into an animated TV series. The change in format resulted in the story being significantly expanded with a subplot of Ming secretly giving military technology to Hitler being dropped, as well as being set in the present day rather during World War II.

The Herbs consisted of a fantasy mix of human and animal characters inhabiting the magical walled garden of a country estate. At the beginning of each episode, the narrator spoke the magic word, ""Herbidacious"", which caused the garden gate to open.

As with The Magic Roundabout, the sophisticated writing style and narrative delivery of The Herbs meant that the appeal was somewhat broader than was originally intended, and much of Parsley's droll humour undoubtedly went over the heads of the age group that was its main target.

The plot was based on the adventures of an American astronaut brigade as they fought off attempted invasions by Shadow Force, a nasty collection of aliens and robots led by the nefarious Emperor Dark.

The show was developed with the help of the Young Astronauts’ Council with the original intention of sparking young viewers’ interest in the U.S. NASA Space Program. However, Starcom did not get much of a chance to make kids want to join the space program as it was cancelled off the air after one brief season. It was revived for a short run in the early 1990s, but no new episodes were aired. It was produced by DiC Enterprises and distributed by Access Syndication.

The plot was classic Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers fare. The evil members of Shadow Force, led by Emperor Dark, were trying to take over the cosmos, and it was up to Starcom to stop them. Young hero Col. James “Dash” Derringer, an ace Starcom pilot, was the star of the series, and several of his teammates were family members. He was also backed up by the resourceful ace pilot John “Slim” Griffin, whose niece was yet another Starcom pilot. Other heroes on the Starcom side included Col. Paul “Crowbar” Corbin and Admiral Franklin Brinkley. The show had very high quality production, with top notch animation and relatively mature subject matter and dialog.",,https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/13785?language=ko,animation,

The 15 minute show was broadcast twice a week, Wednesdays and Fridays, at 5 P.M. Eastern, although some local stations showed both episodes together as a single 30 minute show.

Barker Bill was a portly circus ringmaster with a long black handlebar mustache and dressed in the traditional costume - a fancy suit with white gloves and a top hat.

The show was hosted by a stationary picture of the Barker Bill character with an off-camera announcer introducing the cartoons. The show featured old black and white cartoons obtained from Terrytoons. These were mostly older cartoons from the 1930s, like Farmer Al Falfa and Kiko the Kangaroo, not the more current and better known series such as Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle.

Barker Bill did not appear in cartoons, but was briefly featured in a newspaper comic strip series.

Terrytoons was the first major animation studio to give television a license to show its library of old black and white cartoons. The Barker Bill series was so successful, that that CBS offered to buy the Terrytoons studio, including its production facilities and library of cartoons. Paul Terry accepted the offer and retired in 1955.",,https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/13807?language=ko,animation,

The show has received over 75 awards. The first doctoral dissertation on the program was written in 1991.

It comprised fifty-two episodes; each was written, directed and narrated by Timothy Forder.

The title character was a small creature - with no body as such, he had arms and legs directly attached to his head, and had greyish-blue skin with a mop of brown hair. He wore brown clogs and a wristwatch. Murun lived in the kitchen of a rather dreary house in an unspecified town where it seemed to rain almost constantly. Curiously, given that he lived in a human-scale house, very few full-sized human characters were featured in the cartoon. While many of Murun's acquaintances had human form, they were, in almost every case, the same height as Murun himself. However, a full-sized human character, Nigel, featured in just one episode. As he was so much taller than Murun, all that was seen of him were his legs and feet, like Mammy Two-Shoes in the Tom and Jerry cartoons by MGM.

The series was notable for its oblique, downbeat tone. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given his surroundings, Murun was a somewhat melancholy, philosophical character, though he was not lonely - in fact he had quite a large number of friends, neighbours, family members and acquaintances. Rather than Murun having exciting adventures, the narrative of each episode usually centred around a problem or dilemma that Murun would ponder, sometimes helped by his friends and relatives.",,https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/13825?language=ko,animation,

The pilot was a live-action Shelley Duvall special, in which they were puppets and marionettes; after this was well-received, it was decided to make a cartoon series with the same characters. The cartoon was produced by DIC Entertainment and LBS Communications in association with The Maltese Companies.

Like the toys they're based on, the Popples resemble colorful teddy bears or rabbits with long, pompom-tipped tails, and they have pouches on their backs that can be everted so they resemble fuzzy balls. The name ""Popple"" is a reference to the popping sound they make when unfolding themselves from such a ball, or pulling objects from their pouches. In the cartoon Popples commonly pull large items from their pouches that couldn't possibly fit inside, which come from hammerspace; in ""Popples Alley"", one of the Popples' human friends looks inside one of their pouches and sees numerous objects floating in a void.

Nine of the Popples live with a human brother and sister, Billy and Bonnie Wagner. Billy and Bonnie think they are the only kids who have Popples until a neighbor family moves in and they have their own Popples — the Rock Stars, Pufflings, and Babies. The Popples tend to come around and mess up whatever the kids are trying to do; e.g., if the kids are trying to brush their teeth, the Popples end up spilling water, toothpaste and soap all over the bathroom. If the kids are trying to clean their rooms, the Popples come along, mess up the room even worse and then help them get everything back to normal just in the nick of time.

Gogs revolves around a family clan of dumb, primitive and socially inept cavemen in a fantasy prehistoric Stone Age setting, and contained much dark comedy, various toilet humour-based gags and gross out situations; for example the cavemen losing control of their bodily functions. It also featured their often comedic daily struggle for survival, and attempts to advance their technology and society, such as creating fire, and often failing miserably, comically and absurdly in the act.

The show was more oriented towards an adult audience than other claymation television series such as The Trap Door or Wallace and Gromit, which were more child-friendly than Gogs.

In the 1970s French television produced the cartoon series, directed and co-written by Michel Ocelot, which was then sold to the United Kingdom television company Yorkshire Television and made into an English-language version.

The show's format featured three segments per episode: a 15-minute one, a 30-minute one, and another 15-minute one—with the segments separated by songs and the first segment invariably featuring and emphasizing Sabrina.

Low ratings caused the hourlong format to be shelved by October. The show was retooled, then divided into separate 30-minute shows: Archie's Bang Shang Lollapalooza Show featured Archie's Gang solving mysteries around Riverdale, while Superwitch featured Sabrina solving mysteries using her powers; each show featured one song per episode.

This series was repeated between March and June 1998. A second series of 7x30minute episodes followed between 19–30 September 2000 to tie-in with Channel 4's Animation Week of 23–29 September 2000.

The series began life in 1992 with a pilot episode entitled I Want a Boyfriend ... Or Do I?, co-commissioned by Channel 4 and S4C.

Pond Life was Guard's second breakthrough and was commissioned by Channel 4 in 1996. Scheduling problems marred the series' reception; it was originally intended for broadcast at 9.45pm, but was shown four hours earlier, which required edits to remove adult language. It was shown at the same time as Australian soap Neighbours, and was aimed at the same core audience as the soap. Despite these problems, Pond Life won several awards and received a Writer's Guild nomination for Best Sitcom.

Another set of creatures in the Shadok canon are the Gibis, who are the opposite to the Shadoks in that they are intelligent but vulnerable and also inhabit a two-dimensional planet.

Rouxel claims that the term Shadok obtains some derivation from Captain Haddock of Hergé's The Adventures of Tintin and the Gibis are essentially GBs.

The Shadoks were a significant literary, cultural and philosophical phenomenon in France.

Even today, the French occasionally use satirical comparisons with the Shadoks for policies and attitudes that they consider absurd. The Shadoks were noted for mottos such as:

The series was created by Ruth Byers, a graduate of Baylor University, and Ted Perry a writer at the RATC.

Production of the first episodes began in 1959, with the first episode released in 1965.

The style of the show was kept deliberately simple, both as a cost-cutting measure, and to prevent the design from interfering with the delivery of the message. The main character, JOT, is a white circle with simple facial features, hands and feet. JOT's color and shape would change in response to the struggles presented. This was meant to represent changes in a child's temperament or emotional state, ""somewhat like a thermostat,"" according to one critic. His hands and feet are only seen when he is still; when he is in motion, they disappear. Jot would sometimes be accompanied by Tug, a ""bad"" character who would learn a moral lesson in the end.",,https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/15715?language=ko,animation,

Also, he lives next door to Paula, the love of his life and the attractive girl next door.

There were seven episodes that aired over the summer of 2003, the last ending on a cliff-hanger. However, despite favorable reviews from critics, the show had very low ratings, mainly due to poor promotion and the fact that the original source material was not a huge success in the first place.

The series aired on CBS from 1955 to 1966. The series was credited with popularizing the Mighty Mouse character in popular culture far beyond what the original film shorts had done.

Mighty Mouse was not extraordinarily popular in theatrical cartoons, but was still Terrytoons' most popular character. What made him a cultural icon was television. Most of the short film studios, both live-action and animated, were in decline by the 1950s, pressured both by the loss of film audiences to television as well as the increased popularity of low-budget, stylized, limited animation. Most of the studios cashed out of the short-film production business and began licensing or selling their back catalogs to television. Paul Terry went as far as to sell the entire Terrytoon company to CBS in 1955. The network began running Mighty Mouse Playhouse in December 1955. It remained on the air for nearly twelve years. Mighty Mouse cartoons became a staple of children's television programming for a period of over thirty years, from the 1950s through the 1980s.",anthology cartoon mouse,https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/23466?language=ko,animation,

It premiered in late 1998, as part of the show's structural changes, to appeal to their younger viewers, and to increase their lower ratings. The segment was developed out of a series of workshops that studied the changes in the viewing habits of their audience, and the reasons for the show's lower ratings. ""Elmo's World"" used traditional elements of production, but had a more sustained narrative. It was presented from the perspective of a three-year old child as represented by its host, the Muppet Elmo, who was performed by Kevin Clash. In 2002, Sesame Street's producers changed the rest of the show to reflect its younger demographic and the increase in their viewers' sophistication.

Long-time writer Judy Freudberg came up with the concept of ""Elmo's World"", and writer Tony Geiss and executive producer Arlene Sherman helped develop it. Instead of the realism of the rest of the show, the segment presented Elmo moving between and combining two worlds of live action and computer-generated animation, which looked like a child's squiggly crayon drawing come to life"" created by the host, and with ""a stream-of-consciousness feel to it"".

Famous Classic Tales was shown on CBS, and distributed by Kids Klassics Home Video and Storybook World. It had cartoons from API's Family Classic Tales. Featured cartoons included adaptions of classic literature such as Gulliver's Travels, Treasure Island, Black Beauty, Moby-Dick, and many others. The creation of a series of animated features based on classic children's stories was conceived by Jack Thinnes, Media Director at Sive Advertising in Cincinnati, Ohio. The series was created for a Sive client, Kenner Products, and each program was fully sponsored by Kenner on CBS Television Network on Sunday, late afternoon or early evening, during the prime toy selling season before Christmas. The idea to use classic children's books sprang from Thinnes' viewing of a two minute demo of Dickens' A Christmas Carol, which was produced by Walter Hucker's studio, API, of Sydney, Australia. API was purchased later by Hanna-Barbera Studios after Thinnes introduced the owners of the studios to one another. After the series ran on CBS for nearly ten years, it was moved into local syndication by Sive's syndication department.

The main content of the series is monologues which in a harsh manner criticize the lifestyle of modern everyman. As of August 16, 2012 there are 19 episodes published. The total number of views is more than 35 million.

The earliest five episodes were dubbed by the Russian actor Vadim Demchog. On November 14, 2010 Demchog officially announced his immediate relation to the project. After that, the production of new episodes temporarily ceased, but on January 11, 2011 a new video was released. Since the episode ""Me?"" Vadim Demchog dubs the series again.

It is also known that an animator Pavel Muntyan worked on the first series.

A possible prototype of the series is believed to be the main character of ""Franky-show"", broadcast from 2003 to 2011 on the Silver Rain Radio, which is also dubbed by exactly Vadim Demchog, and the script writer of some episodes is Pavel Muntyan.
