This show is about a spunky dog who is abducted by aliens from Planet Zmed, whose king is King Adrian, sets two of Zmed's explorers, named Dave and Blark, in search for Earth's leader; the one that everyone follows.

At the very moment that they reached the Earth, a dog was trying to escape a maximum security city pound. With so many dogcatchers chasing the dog, Dave and Blark mistook the dog for Earth's leader. Immediately, they caught the dog, and the people of Zmed swore him in as a leader.

Mainly, the newly named ""Leader"" is showing the people of Zmed what and how he does things on Earth. But with Leader being a dog, he is mainly showing the race what he and other dogs do on earth. With this, some of the more canine things he does are considered great feats to the Zmedians, like drinking from the toilet, playing dead, and even having a massive and rather nasty bowel movement.

The characters consist of King Adrian, the king who loves Leader and his ways, as well as Adrian's son, a spoiled young prince named Prince Guz who totally despises Leader in every way; and the twin explorers named Dave and Blark who saved Leader. Each episode is only one to three minutes long and aired randomly on Nicktoons."

The show was created by a Burbank, California production company Popular Arts Entertainment, with Jonathan Katz and Tom Snyder, developed and first made by Popular Arts for HBO Downtown Productions. Boston-based Tom Snyder Productions became the hands-on production company, and the episodes were usually produced by Katz and Loren Bouchard.

The show was computer animated in a crude, easily recognizable style produced with the software Squigglevision in which all persons and animate objects are colored and have constantly squiggling outlines, while most other inanimate objects are static and usually gray in color. The original challenge Popular Arts faced was how to repurpose recorded stand-up comedy material. To do so they based Dr. Katz's patients on stand-up comics for the first several episodes, simply having them recite their stand-up acts. The secondary challenge was how to affordably animate on cable TV at the time. Snyder had Squigglevision, an inexpensive means of getting animation on cable, which could not afford traditional animation processes. A partnership between Popular Arts, Tom Snyder Productions and Jonathan Katz was formed and Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist was born."

It was created by George and his wife, Peggy Sarson. Although it is primarily aimed at young children, it has found popularity with pre-teens to young adults because despite the fairly young and lighthearted appearance of the show, it had some rather dark undertones beneath the surface. Its cult appreciation has also stemmed from the fact that Toad Patrol had so much time and effort put into it. This series has a very distinct beginning, middle, and end to each season it airs. The story was in the works since 1985 and was in the development stage as the creators started selling Mistle Toad chocolates and cream pops to raise money. The show eventually managed to get animated overseas in both Korea, AKOM and India, UTV Toons. Although, a lot of the in-betweening and other works were done in Canada at Funbag and Helix studios.

A show sponsor page has stated that 13 episodes of the series are currently in production. Several fans had assumed that with the passing of Long John Baldry, the series had been halted however, that is not the case. After discovering that Mistle Toad had two voice actors, fans are now sure that if a third season were to appear then that voice actor would take his place.

In each episode, the three of them would descend in the lift from their flat in the tower block. After their adventures they would return home, Midge would press the button for the lift back to the correct floor, by standing on Mungo's nose.

The series was produced by Nelvana, a Toronto animation studio, and created by Canadian David Fine and Brit Alison Snowden. The series was based on the Academy Award winning short film Bob's Birthday, featuring the same main characters, which won the Best Animated Short Film Oscar in 1994. The series is one of the few Canadian TV shows to ever have regular American exposure. In Canada, it was the highest rated Canadian made animation series ever when it aired in prime time on Global Television.

The show revolved around a married English couple named Bob and Margaret Fish, a middle class 40-ish working couple with no children and two dogs named William and Elizabeth. Bob is a dentist and Margaret is a chiropodist. Bob and Margaret struggle with everyday issues and mid life crisis. Stories often revolve around the mundane, but in a way which is eminently relatable. From the trials of shopping to dealing with friends who annoy them, but owe them a dinner.

In the first two seasons, Bob and Margaret lived in England, in the South London community of Balham. For the third and fourth seasons, however, they moved to Toronto, Canada, allowing the writers to explore the humour of culture clash. The move was actually inspired by the realities of funding, with certain Canadian tax benefits dependent on stories actually based in Canada. As such, to keep the series funded, the move was necessary. The creators of the series chose to take an executive role on these latter two seasons, reviewing scripts and consulting, but not involved in the detail they were for the first two seasons. Snowden continued to provide the voice of Margaret, but Bob's voice, originally played by Andy Hamilton, was replaced by Brian George."

11152,Time for Timer,Animation,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/tTzb0RrlhLJI0Ei3PGSQepEvt4G.jpg,1,7.0,"Time for Timer was the collective title for a short series of public service announcements broadcast on Saturday mornings on the ABC television network starting in the early 1970s. The animated spots featured Timer, a tiny cartoon character who represented the sense of ""time"" in the human body. Timer was in charge of when a person felt it was time to eat, time to sleep, etc. He carried a large pocket watch inside of him, which would often set off an alarm whenever something was about to happen.

Usually wearing a bow tie and top hat, Timer looked somewhat like a little yellow blob with long arms and legs, and a face. Timer also had limited magical powers, such as instant transportation, which he often used to exit his host body from time to time if things got too exhausting. A wise-cracker as well as a song-and-dance man, Timer promoted healthy eating and personal hygiene for children, using clever songs and animation.

Like ABC's The Bod Squad series, the segments never carried official titles, but are referred to by memorable catch phrases in the songs' lyrics. Perhaps most memorable was ""I Hanker for a Hunk of Cheese"" in which Timer, recast as a cowboy with a thick Western accent, suggests ""wagon wheels,"" sandwiches made with cheese slices and crackers as an easy and nutritious snack. Others included ""You Are What You Eat"", ""Quickie Breakfast"", and ""Sunshine on a Stick""."

The segments generally appeared at half-hour intervals, interspersed with regular commercials, between Saturday morning cartoon programs. While many were not labeled as such, at least four or five segments ended with an announcement, ""Another nutritional message from the ABC Television Network,"" and accompanying stock animation identifying the series as The ABC Bod Squad. The same original segments produced in the 1970s repeated every Saturday morning for nearly 20 years, so that many if not most Americans who were TV-watching children during that period are familiar with them.

The Bod Squad segments never carried official titles but are informally known by the catch phrases from their lyrics. Some of the memorable Bod Squad segments included

To help their cause the heroes lead the formation of an alliance beginning with King Thun, leader of the Lion People; Prince Barin, ruler of Arboria; and King Vultan, leader of the Hawkmen.

The original project was produced as a made-for-television feature film. When NBC saw the finished work, it was decided to turn the work into an animated TV series. The change in format resulted in the story being significantly expanded with a subplot of Ming secretly giving military technology to Hitler being dropped, as well as being set in the present day rather during World War II.

The Herbs consisted of a fantasy mix of human and animal characters inhabiting the magical walled garden of a country estate. At the beginning of each episode, the narrator spoke the magic word, ""Herbidacious"", which caused the garden gate to open.

As with The Magic Roundabout, the sophisticated writing style and narrative delivery of The Herbs meant that the appeal was somewhat broader than was originally intended, and much of Parsley's droll humour undoubtedly went over the heads of the age group that was its main target. Consequently, it still retains a following among those who watched it when it was first broadcast."

Unlike the theatrical cartoons, which focused on the extremely nearsighted Quincy Magoo's bumbling, the show featured the Magoo character as an actor in adaptations of such literary classics as Don Quixote and Gunga Din.

It has the distinction of being the last Cosgrove Hall cartoon to be animated using hand painted animation cels, as all 2D animated series from the studio thereafter would use computers for the ink and paint process; with the animation drawings scanned and then digitally coloured.

The story revolves around three bike riding Penguins that inhabit Big City, uniting to protect it and its citizens from the evil Caractacus P. Doom, an insane and reclusive criminal scientist. The Penguins attempt to prevent Doom's schemes but find themselves often hampered by their own miscommunicating and occasional scraps with other biker gangs infesting Big City, such as The Stink Brothers, a canine squad of Hell's Angels. As with most Cosgrove Hall cartoons, the series poked fun at the popular concepts of having creatures performing inhuman action feats and stunts in an animated medium, made popular by the then enormously successful Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise. The core the show's themes is heavily and coincidently similar to Biker Mice from Mars, although with the two shows being aired at exactly the same time, and from two different parts of the world that hadn't any connections whatsoever with each other, it is completely difficult to determine who ripped off who."

Barker Bill was a portly circus ringmaster with a long black handlebar mustache and dressed in the traditional costume - a fancy suit with white gloves and a top hat.

The show was hosted by a stationary picture of the Barker Bill character with an off-camera announcer introducing the cartoons. The show featured old black and white cartoons obtained from Terrytoons. These were mostly older cartoons from the 1930s, like Farmer Al Falfa and Kiko the Kangaroo, not the more current and better known series such as Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle.

Barker Bill did not appear in cartoons, but was briefly featured in a newspaper comic strip series.

Terrytoons was the first major animation studio to give television a license to show its library of old black and white cartoons.

It comprised fifty-two episodes; each was written, directed and narrated by Timothy Forder.

The title character was a small creature - with no body as such, he had arms and legs directly attached to his head, and had greyish-blue skin with a mop of brown hair. He wore brown clogs and a wristwatch. Murun lived in the kitchen of a rather dreary house in an unspecified town where it seemed to rain almost constantly. Curiously, given that he lived in a human-scale house, very few full-sized human characters were featured in the cartoon. While many of Murun's acquaintances had human form, they were, in almost every case, the same height as Murun himself. However, a full-sized human character, Nigel, featured in just one episode. As he was so much taller than Murun, all that was seen of him were his legs and feet, like Mammy Two-Shoes in the Tom and Jerry cartoons by MGM.

The series was notable for its oblique, downbeat tone. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given his surroundings, Murun was a somewhat melancholy, philosophical character, though he was not lonely - in fact he had quite a large number of friends, neighbours, family members and acquaintances. Rather than Murun having exciting adventures, the narrative of each episode usually centred around a problem or dilemma that Murun would ponder, sometimes helped by his friends and relatives."

The cartoon was produced by DIC Entertainment and LBS Communications in association with The Maltese Companies.

Like the toys they're based on, the Popples resemble colorful teddy bears or rabbits with long, pompom-tipped tails, and they have pouches on their backs that can be everted so they resemble fuzzy balls. The name ""Popple"" is a reference to the popping sound they make when unfolding themselves from such a ball, or pulling objects from their pouches. In the cartoon Popples commonly pull large items from their pouches that couldn't possibly fit inside, which come from hammerspace; in ""Popples Alley"", one of the Popples' human friends looks inside one of their pouches and sees numerous objects floating in a void.

Nine of the Popples live with a human brother and sister, Billy and Bonnie Wagner. Billy and Bonnie think they are the only kids who have Popples until a neighbor family moves in and they have their own Popples — the Rock Stars, Pufflings, and Babies. The Popples tend to come around and mess up whatever the kids are trying to do; e.g., if the kids are trying to brush their teeth, the Popples end up spilling water, toothpaste and soap all over the bathroom.

Another set of creatures in the Shadok canon are the Gibis, who are the opposite to the Shadoks in that they are intelligent but vulnerable and also inhabit a two-dimensional planet.

Rouxel claims that the term Shadok obtains some derivation from Captain Haddock of Hergé's The Adventures of Tintin and the Gibis are essentially GBs.

The Shadoks were a significant literary, cultural and philosophical phenomenon in France.

Even today, the French occasionally use satirical comparisons with the Shadoks for policies and attitudes that they consider absurd. The Shadoks were noted for mottos such as:

⁕""Why do it the easy way when you can do it the hard way?""

⁕""When one tries continuously, one ends up succeeding. Thus, the more one fails, the greater the chance that it will work."""

The pair was commissioned by Dr. Paul Stevens, president of the RATC, to develop a television show that would provide simple moral lessons for young children. Production of the first episodes began in 1959, with the first episode released in 1965.

The style of the show was kept deliberately simple, both as a cost-cutting measure, and to prevent the design from interfering with the delivery of the message. The main character, JOT, is a white circle with simple facial features, hands and feet. JOT's color and shape would change in response to the struggles presented. This was meant to represent changes in a child's temperament or emotional state, ""somewhat like a thermostat,"" according to one critic. His hands and feet are only seen when he is still; when he is in motion, they disappear. Jot would sometimes be accompanied by Tug, a ""bad"" character who would learn a moral lesson in the end."

Mighty Mouse was not extraordinarily popular in theatrical cartoons, but was still Terrytoons' most popular character. What made him a cultural icon was television. Most of the short film studios, both live-action and animated, were in decline by the 1950s, pressured both by the loss of film audiences to television as well as the increased popularity of low-budget, stylized, limited animation. Most of the studios cashed out of the short-film production business and began licensing or selling their back catalogs to television. Paul Terry went as far as to sell the entire Terrytoon company to CBS in 1955. The network began running Mighty Mouse Playhouse in December 1955. It remained on the air for nearly twelve years. Mighty Mouse cartoons became a staple of children's television programming for a period of over thirty years, from the 1950s through the 1980s."

It premiered in late 1998, as part of the show's structural changes, to appeal to their younger viewers, and to increase their lower ratings. The segment was developed out of a series of workshops that studied the changes in the viewing habits of their audience, and the reasons for the show's lower ratings. ""Elmo's World"" used traditional elements of production, but had a more sustained narrative. It was presented from the perspective of a three-year old child as represented by its host, the Muppet Elmo, who was performed by Kevin Clash. In 2002, Sesame Street's producers changed the rest of the show to reflect its younger demographic and the increase in their viewers' sophistication.

Long-time writer Judy Freudberg came up with the concept of ""Elmo's World"", and writer Tony Geiss and executive producer Arlene Sherman helped develop it. Instead of the realism of the rest of the show, the segment presented Elmo moving between and combining two worlds of live action and computer-generated animation, which looked like a child's squiggly crayon drawing come to life"" created by the host, and with ""a stream-of-consciousness feel to it"". In addition to Elmo, two other important characters in ""Elmo's World"", Elmo's pet goldfish Dorothy and the members of the Noodle family, were silent in order to allow Elmo to do all the talking, and to give children the opportunity to respond to what they saw on the screen."

Some of the cartoons are interactive and game-like. All cartoons are in the Adobe Flash format, although Xiao Xiao #1 was originally in AVI format. It has now been converted to Flash format.

""Xiao Xiao"" literally is the Chinese character for ""small"" repeated twice in Mandarin Chinese; here this reduplication connotes an affectionate diminutive – an equivalent might be the English expression ""itty bitty"" or ""lil' old"". Each Xiao Xiao cartoon is given a Chinese title with the adjective ""Xiao Xiao"" preceding a descriptive noun phrase. Xiao Xiao #1 was originally titled ""Xiao Xiao Zuo Pin"", which translates to ""A Little Bit of Creative Work"". Since then each Xiao Xiao cartoon has had a different noun succeeding ""Xiao Xiao"" – #4 is titled ""Little Sheriff"", and #7 is titled ""Little Movie"".

The term has gradually shifted meaning from the cartoons themselves to the main character, an anonymous black stick-figure – in this context it means something akin to ""little fella"", appropriate since in most perspectives Xiao Xiao and his fellow stick-people appear tiny and childlike, with disproportionately large heads and small limbs."

Famous Classic Tales was shown on CBS, and distributed by Kids Klassics Home Video and Storybook World. It had cartoons from API's Family Classic Tales. Featured cartoons included adaptions of classic literature such as Gulliver's Travels, Treasure Island, Black Beauty, Moby-Dick, and many others.

The series was created for a Sive client, Kenner Products, and each program was fully sponsored by Kenner on CBS Television Network on Sunday, late afternoon or early evening, during the prime toy selling season before Christmas. The idea to use classic children's books sprang from Thinnes' viewing of a two minute demo of Dickens' A Christmas Carol, which was produced by Walter Hucker's studio, API, of Sydney, Australia. API was purchased later by Hanna-Barbera Studios after Thinnes introduced the owners of the studios to one another. After the series ran on CBS for nearly ten years, it was moved into local syndication by Sive's syndication department.

The total number of views is more than 35 million.

The earliest five episodes were dubbed by the Russian actor Vadim Demchog. On November 14, 2010 Demchog officially announced his immediate relation to the project.
